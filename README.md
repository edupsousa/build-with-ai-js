# Build With AI Workshop - React Sample

## Introduction

This is a sample project for the Build With AI Workshop. It is a simple React application that uses the
[Google AI Studio API](https://aistudio.google.com/) to create a chat application.

You can use the application at [https://build-with-ai-js.web.app/](https://build-with-ai-js.web.app/).

To use it you first need to create an API key by going to (https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)[https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey] and then click on the "Create API Key" button. Copy the key and paste it in the screen that appears when you open the application.

## Running Locally / Contributing

To run the application locally, you need to have Node.js installed. You can download it from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/).

Clone this repository and then run:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The local development server will start and you can access the application at [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/).

To deploy the application to Firebase, you need to create a Firebase project and then use the Firebase CLI
to login and configure the project by following the instructions at [https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli) and [https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/quickstart](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/quickstart).
